Introducing Shoddy Blog!

![unicatte's Wonderland Online character waving at the viewer](../data/blog-intro/wlo-waving.png)

Welcome to the official blog of Shoddy Infrastructures - the Shoddy Blog, because how else would I call it?

On this blog I intend to post about various things I'm personally interested in, such as technology or video games. I will also use it to put stuff I create here and I will talk about things that are relevant to Shoddy Infrastructures in general.

The website runs on GitLab and I also mirror it to GitHub (I can't afford a VPS at the moment ðŸ˜…). I found that GitHub provides much faster load times so I mostly rely on the GitHub site. To create the blog I'm using [blogit](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit), which is a makefile-based & git-based static blog generator.

Stay tuned for any going-ons and take good care of yourselves!
